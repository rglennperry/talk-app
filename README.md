# Talk - Communication Aid

A free, open-source communication app for people who have difficulty speaking — built for stroke recovery, but useful for anyone who needs help being heard.

Tap a button, and the app speaks the phrase aloud and displays it in large text. Customise the phrases, categories, and favourites to match the person's needs.

## Tips

- **No sound?** Make sure the device isn't muted (check the physical silent switch on iPad). Tap any button once — iOS requires a user interaction before allowing audio.
- **Text-to-speech voice** — the app prefers a natural-sounding English voice. On iOS devices, you can install additional voices in Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > Voices.
- **Clearing Safari data** will reset all customisations. Use the admin panel's Export feature to back up your setup.
- **Updating** — when improvements are published, the app updates automatically the next time you open it while online.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Add to Home Screen" missing | Must use Safari on iOS, Chrome on Android |
| No sound | Check mute switch. Tap any button once to activate audio |
| App not working offline | Open it once while connected to WiFi first |
| Old version still showing | Close the app completely, reopen while online, close and reopen again |
