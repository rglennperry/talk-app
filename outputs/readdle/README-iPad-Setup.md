## Step 2: Get the File onto the iPad

Pick whichever method is easiest for you:

### Option A: AirDrop (if you have a Mac or MacBook nearby)

1. On your Mac, find the file called **Talk-Communicator.html**
2. Right-click it and choose **Share > AirDrop**
3. Select the iPad from the list
4. On the iPad, accept the file
5. When asked "Open with...", choose **Documents**

### Option B: Email

1. On a computer, email the file **Talk-Communicator.html** to yourself as an attachment
2. On the iPad, open the **Mail** app and find that email
3. Tap and hold the attachment
4. Choose **Share** then **Copy to Documents** (or "Open in Documents")

### Option C: iCloud Drive

1. On your computer, copy **Talk-Communicator.html** into your **iCloud Drive** folder
2. On the iPad, open the **Documents** app
3. Tap **iCloud** in the sidebar on the left
4. Find **Talk-Communicator.html** and tap it

## Step 3: Open the Communicator

1. Open the **Documents** app on the iPad
2. Find **Talk-Communicator.html** (it will be in "My Files" or wherever you saved it)
3. Tap the file -- it opens right inside the app
4. You should see coloured tiles with words on them
5. **Tap any tile to hear it spoken aloud**

### To go full screen:
- Tap the **share icon** (square with an arrow) and choose **Open in Browser**
- Or use the Documents app's own full-screen mode (look for a double-arrow icon)

## Tips for Daily Use

- **Keep the file inside the Documents app** -- don't move it to the Files app, as it works best inside Documents
- **If no sound comes out:**
  - Check the **silent mode switch** on the side of the iPad (push it so no orange dot is showing)
  - Turn the **volume up** using the buttons on the side
- **Favourites and Recents are saved automatically** -- the tiles you use most will appear in Quick Access
- **Landscape mode** (iPad turned sideways) gives you bigger tiles and more space
- **Portrait mode** (iPad upright) works too, just with smaller tiles

## Updating the App

If you receive a new version of the file:

1. Save the new **Talk-Communicator.html** to the iPad (using AirDrop, email, or iCloud -- same as Step 2)
2. When asked, choose to **replace** the old file
3. That's it -- open it and the new version is ready

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to do |
|---------|-----------|
| **No sound** | Check the silent mode switch on the side of the iPad (push it so no orange is showing). Turn volume up. |
| **Tiles look too small** | Turn the iPad to landscape mode (sideways). |
| **Speech sounds robotic** | This is normal -- the iPad's built-in voice is doing the talking. You can try changing the voice in iPad Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content. |
| **Lost favourites/recents** | They are saved in the browser's memory. If you clear the Documents app cache or delete and reinstall the app, they will reset. |
| **File won't open** | Make sure you're opening it inside the Documents app, not the Files app. |
| **App asks to connect to internet** | The communicator works fully offline. You can skip or dismiss any internet prompts. |
